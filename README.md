## 📌 Objective

Urban parking is a limited resource. This project aims to build a **real-time dynamic pricing engine** for 14 urban parking lots using data-driven models built with only `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Pathway`.  
The goal is to improve utilization by adjusting parking prices dynamically based on demand, environment, and vehicle factors.'Bokeh' for visualisation
